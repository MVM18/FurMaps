# Clickable Services Feature

## Overview
This feature allows pet owners to book any of a provider's services directly from the ProviderProfile component. The "Other Services Offered" section now displays clickable service cards that open the BookingModal for the selected service.

## How It Works

### 1. Enhanced Service Display
- Services are now displayed as interactive cards instead of a simple list
- Each service card shows:
  - Service icon (based on service type)
  - Service name
  - Service type
  - Price
  - "Book Now" button with arrow icon

### 2. Interactive Elements
- **Hover Effects**: Cards lift up and change color on hover
- **Click Handler**: Clicking any service card opens the BookingModal
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication that services are clickable

### 3. Seamless Booking Flow
1. User clicks on a service in the provider profile
2. Provider profile modal closes
3. BookingModal opens with the selected service
4. User can proceed with booking as normal

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:

1. **`src/pages/PetOwner/ProviderProfile.js`**
   - Added `onServiceClick` prop
   - Enhanced service data formatting to match BookingModal expectations
   - Added clickable service cards with hover effects
   - Added service icons for better visual appeal

2. **`src/pages/PetOwner/HomepagePetOwner.js`**
   - Added `onServiceClick` handler to ProviderProfile component
   - Handles service selection and modal transitions

3. **`src/components/BookingModal.js`**

### Service Data Formatting
Services are formatted to match the expected structure for BookingModal:
```javascript
{
  id: service.id,
  name: service.name,
  location: service.location,
  serviceType: service.service_type,
  price: service.price,
  provider_id: service.provider_id,
  provider_name: `${provider.first_name} ${provider.last_name}`,
  // ... other required fields
}
```
